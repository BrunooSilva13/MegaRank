## Technologies used:

##### - C# ASP.NET
##### - Docker Compose with two containers - MySQL and Adminer
##### - MySQL Client package

# Project:
##### I'm developing a Rank API using C# ASP.NET, which offers CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). To manage the database, I'm using Docker Compose, which includes two containers: one for the MySQL database and another for Adminer, a database management tool with a graphical interface. With Adminer, I can access the database through a graphical interface via a web browser, simply by going to the address 'localhost:8080/'.
